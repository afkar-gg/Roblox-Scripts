### Webhook Joki

This is legacy version of the finalized code on the Roblox-Joki-Proxy file

---

the only difference:
- using webhook instead of cloudflare tunnel
- no auto check and completed embed
- simpler to understand

---

~ Loadstring :
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afkar-gg/Roblox-Scripts/refs/heads/main/Webhook-Joki/main.lua"))();
```
