### Webhook Joki

This is legacy version of the finalized code on the Roblox-Joki-Proxy file

---

the only difference:
- using webhook instead of cloudflare tunnel
- no auto check and completed embed
- simpler to understand

---

~ Loadstring :
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afkar-gg/Roblox-Scripts/ccc27be9581e2c3b643bb19713107aef081e1701/Webhook-Joki/main.lua"))();
```
> the loadstring are temporarily using ccc27be version because im lazy to update it
